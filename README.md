# chinampas
Code for the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15265

Here we add a [python program](main.py) to find those chinampas of profit 0.

A chinampa of arbitrary profit looks like the figure below.

Zooming out, we see isoceles right triangles of different size but all looking at the same direction, stack into each other.

Zooming in, we see a model of neural activations, or cellular automata following rule 192.


We also added [a pdf](R7.pdf)  with our calculations to determine the generating series of the triangular sequence R7.
